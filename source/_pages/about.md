I am a designer who has become a product manager after a few years as a developer advocacy and product marketing leader.

My personal work is at the intersection of technology, storytelling, and sustainability. I explore ways to craft products and experiences that align with a vision of desirable futures.

I seek to build tools and systems that empower individuals to navigate complexity, make informed choices, and create meaningful impact while facing the Anthropocene age.

I believe in design as a force for resilience, joy, and emancipationâ€”helping people shape the future rather than merely adapting to it.

Storytelling is at the heart of my approach. It creates alignment, brings visibility, and fuels desirability, turning ideas into shared visions that inspire action.

I am committed to building products that solve problems and contribute to a more sustainable, ethical, and beautiful world.

Design can change the world, inspire, and empower. Let's bring beauty to this world!
