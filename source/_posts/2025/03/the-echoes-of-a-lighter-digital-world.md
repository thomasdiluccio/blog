excerpt: |
    Sometimes, we let the machine hum louder than our own voice. Stepping away from the endless buzz showed me an empowering path toward a custom frugal way to share my thoughts. Less can mean more, leaving a gentle hush for true expression to bloom.

Sometimes, we forget how easy it is to get caught up in the rush of technology. Extracting yourself from the flow and the status quo takes some effort.

This is the first post I write on my new blog. My old WordPress setup was always running, always there consuming so much resources, just in case. It was like feeding a machine that never slept, even though my needs were simpleâ€”a place to share words, stories, and a bit of myself. And I write once in a blue moon.

Then, I stepped back and realized that each extra feature was another knot tied around my creativity. I traded the constant hum of a giant website for the calm of a static approach. Jigsaw, Laravel, Docker. Yes, they sound technical, but they feel lighter. They only run when I need them. 

My posts are stored in Markdown, and the blog is fully static. An integration links the repository and the hosted app. One GIT push, and the static site rebuilds itself like a gentle wave returning to shore. Efforless. Simple. Minimalist.

At first, I worried I was simply piling on more complexity. But the more I learn, the less waste I create. It's like a balancing act: more knowledge, fewer burdens. I'm still far from pure low-tech, yet there is a quiet beauty in this new path.

The site is smaller, faster, and closer to my hope for less. It is using the smallest resources I can possibly allocate. I can almost feel the peaceful silence in the moments when I'm not writing, not coding, not tinkering with an admin panel.

Is this the way forward? I can't be sure. But it's a thoughtful step.

A reflection on how the right tools can help us live with a little less noise. Let there be a bit of stillness in our ever-churning world. In that stillness, maybe we'll finally hear our voices more clearly.

This step required a bit of effort. I learned new things to build myself the tool I needed to shape a lighter and brighter world.

To desirable futures,

Thomas
